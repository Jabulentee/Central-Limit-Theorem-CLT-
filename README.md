## Central Limit Theorem (CLT) Demonstration Project

### Overview
This project provides a hands-on demonstration of the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**—a cornerstone concept in statistics that explains why the sampling distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution regardless of the population's underlying distribution. Through systematic simulations and visualizations, we validate how CLT enables reliable statistical inference for real-world data that often deviates from normality.

### Methodology
**1. Population Distributions Simulated:**  
- Skewed (Exponential/Gamma)  
- Uniform  
- Binomial  
- Custom non-normal distributions  

**2. Sampling Process:**  
- Repeated random sampling performed for each population  
- Multiple sample sizes tested: `n = 5`, `n = 30`, `n = 100`  
- 1,000 iterations per sample size to build sampling distributions  

**3. Visualization Approach:**  
- Side-by-side comparison of population distributions vs. sampling distributions  
- Histograms with KDE overlays to highlight distribution shapes  
- Q-Q plots to assess normality convergence  
- Animated plots (optional) showing distribution evolution  

**4. Statistical Validation:**  
- Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality  
- Analysis of mean/standard deviation of sampling distributions  
- Comparison of sampling distribution spread (σ/√n) vs. theoretical SE

### Key Findings  
✅ **Normality from Non-Normal Data**  
Sampling distributions converged to normality for `n ≥ 30` across all populations—even highly skewed ones.  

📈 **Sample Size Matters**  
- `n = 5`: Sampling distribution retained population shape  
- `n = 30`: Clear normal approximation emerged  
- `n = 100`: Near-perfect normality regardless of source distribution  

⚖️ **Mean Convergence**  
The mean of sample means consistently equaled the population mean (μ), validating the *law of large numbers*.  

📉 **Variance Reduction**  
Standard error of the mean (SEM) decreased by factor 1/√n, aligning with theoretical predictions.

### How to Reproduce
1. Install requirements:  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

2. Run simulations:  
```python
from simulations import run_clt_simulation

# Generate sampling distribution for exponential population
run_clt_simulation(
    population_type='exponential',
    sample_size=30,
    iterations=1000
)
```

3. Generate visualizations:  
```python
from visualization import plot_distributions

# Compare population and sampling distributions
plot_distributions(population_data, sample_means)
```

### Key Takeaways for Practitioners
🔹 **Inference Robustness**  
CLT justifies using parametric tests (t-tests, ANOVA) with real-world skewed data when `n ≥ 30`.  

🔹 **Confidence Intervals**  
Sampling distributions enable accurate confidence intervals: `x̄ ± z*(σ/√n)`  

🔹 **Error Control**  
Standard error quantifies estimate precision—critical for A/B testing and model evaluation.  

🔹 **Foundational Principle**  
Understanding CLT is essential for bootstrapping, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.
